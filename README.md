# Password Manager

## Description
Password Manager is a simple tool used to securely store and manage your passwords.

## Motivation
The goal behind this project was to store account information in a single, local solution that would allow me to view all of my account information in one place -- by simply scrolling through account names. At the same time, I realized this project would give me practical experience working with databases, creating a simple python backend, and designing a lightweight GUI.
